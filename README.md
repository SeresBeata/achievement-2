### Introduction

The aim of this project was to create a small, responsive Pokédex web application, that loads data from an external public Pokémon API and enables the viewing of data points of Pokémon in detail. The project itself was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

All Pokémon data loaded from [https://pokeapi.co/](https://pokeapi.co/).

Many thanks go to **Amit Mondal** for his card flip animation, which has been implemented in the project. You can find his animation in the **References** section.
